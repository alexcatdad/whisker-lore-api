# World Expansion Design - Brainstorming Session

**Date**: 2026-01-16
**Status**: In Progress (session paused)

## Overview

This document captures world-building details explored through collaborative brainstorming. These expand on the existing lore to create a more detailed picture of daily life, systems, and culture in Neko-kuni.

## Arrival & Newcomer Experience

### The Gate Experience
- Gates are located on busy roads; someone will pass by
- Newcomers can ask questions and get escorted/pointed to the first town
- **Alternate path**: "Scaredy cat" branch - cat runs away, avoids initial tutorial flow, goes solo

### Newcomer Support System
- Established by the first reincarnates as a "pay it forward" tradition
- Towns have dedicated buildings; villages have a dedicated NPC helper
- **Vibe**: Warm and welcoming - cozy common rooms, gentle staff who've seen this a thousand times
- Staff are former reincarnates who chose to help others through the transition
- Provides: basic housing, basic food and water (free)

### Transformation
- The Gate grants basic abilities - cats arrive functional if clumsy
- Cats are naturally agile and athletic; they figure it out quickly
- A few harmless stumbles early on for story flavor
- Physical adjustment is fast; emotional/mental takes longer

## Character Creation & Backstory

### Backstory Categories

**Main Categories**:
- Housecat
- Stray
- Feral

**Subtypes** (examples for housecats):
- Pampered indoor cat - never went outside, everything provided
- Shop cat - lived in bookstore/bodega, used to strangers and commerce
- Farm cat - semi-independent, had "jobs" (mousing), outdoor access
- Elderly companion - bonded deeply with one person, possibly outlived them
- Shelter cat - knew multiple homes, learned to adapt

**Additional Dimensions**:
- Geographic origin (Tokyo vs Cairo vs New York = different cultural tendencies)
- Unusual life circumstances (ship's cat, circus cat, celebrity's cat, laboratory cat)
- Manner of death/abandonment: **hinted at but never explicit** (too dark for tone)

### Struggle System
- Backstory creates "Struggle" buffs and debuffs
- Example: Shop cat might have commerce buff but solitude debuff
- Different backgrounds = different starting challenges
- Pampered housecat struggles with independence
- Stray already knows survival but has trust issues

---

## Personal Quests

### The Core Motivation
Every player's cat has a personal quest baked into their character sheet - something pulling them forward:
- Find a cat from their past life
- Find a cat they should have met but didn't
- Find something an ancestor left in this world
- Find the perfect nap spot in the world
- Find their favorite toy (transported separately)
- Find their human's sock (socks get transported to this world - lore item)

### Resolution Options (Player Choice)
- **Pursue actively** - chase it across all five provinces
- **Let it fade** - build a new life, the quest recedes
- **Explicit letting go** - a deliberate moment where you choose to release it
  - This triggers a new story/world branch for that player
  - "Letting go" is not failure - it's transformation

---

## Daily Life & Work

### Work as Core Loop
- Work provides purpose (theme) and progress (mechanics)
- Physical workplaces - you travel there, see coworkers, do tasks

### Workplace Activities
- **Repeatable tasks** - prep, serve, clean, repeat with skill growth
- **Quest-like assignments** - boss gives specific jobs with beginnings and ends
- **NPC relationships** - develop over time through heavy dialogue
- NPC relationships affect RNG chances in their profession

### NPCs
- Each has a character sheet
- NLP-powered conversations (limited)
- Player can steer conversations in directions
- Dynamic opinions based on player actions

---

## Provinces

### Province Identity
- **Dramatically different** - different jobs, rhythms, social norms
- Almost like different games in terms of daily experience

### Movement Between Provinces
- Cats move freely and regularly
- Creates choice: specialize in one province's way of life, or become worldly

### What Drives Travel
- **Work reasons** - trade routes, specialized training, guild assignments
- **Personal quests** - looking for someone/something (core motivator)
- **Seasonal/events** - festivals, harvests, limited goods

---

## Day/Night System

### Circadian Types
- **Diurnal** - day-active (farmers, merchants, administrators)
- **Nocturnal** - night-active (guards, artists, night market vendors)
- **Crepuscular** - twilight-active (bridges both worlds)

### Circadian as Core Identity
- Shapes who you meet, what jobs are available, which events you see
- Day cats and night cats are almost separate communities
- **Source of social tension** - cultural friction without villains
  - Day cats might distrust "secretive night-stalkers"
  - Night cats might see day cats as "shallow sunbathers"

### Crepuscular Cats
- Natural diplomats/bridges between communities
- Key story-important NPCs are often crepuscular
- "Jack of all trades, master of none" mechanically
- **Unique ability**: Only ones who can permanently shift to diurnal or nocturnal

---

## Housing

### Importance
- Central hub - start each day, store things, customize, express yourself
- Social space - friends visit, roommates share, parties happen
- Mechanical benefits - rest quality, crafting options, storage
- Status symbol - reflects your journey

### Living Arrangements (each has buffs/debuffs)
- **Solo living** - specific trade-offs
- **Shared/state living** - newcomer housing, stable but limited
- **Roommate living** - social buffs, shared costs, less control
- **Ownership** - full customization, enables "home workshop"

### Home Workshop
- Unlocked through ownership
- Ties directly to profession
- Multiple uses:
  - **Supplement** - practice, improve faster, prep work
  - **Side business** - private commissions, sell directly
  - **Specialization** - develop niches your main workplace doesn't support

---

## Economy

### Currency: Koban
Basic needs are free (healthcare, education, basic housing, emergency food)

### What Money Buys
- **Comfort and quality** - better food, nicer housing, finer materials
- **Self-expression** - fashion, home decor, personal style
- **Opportunity** - buying a shop, funding a journey, investing in others
- **NOT social standing** - you can't buy friendship

### Social Gestures (non-monetary)
- Time and presence - sharing a meal you cooked, helping with tasks
- Crafted gifts - something you made > something you bought
- Acts of service - helping a friend move, covering their shift, mentoring

---

## User-Generated Content

### What Players Can Create
- Start with: Visual patterns/textures on existing item templates
- Potentially expand to: Full items, functional items

### Applications
- Home decoration
- Clothing and accessories

### Benefits
- Uniqueness (no two cats look the same)
- Multiplayer element
- Enhances commerce

### How Creations Enter Economy
- **Marketplace/auction** - centralized browsing and bidding
- **Commission system** - request custom work, negotiate
- **Free sharing** - some creators just want their work in the world
- No fixed storefronts - economy is social, reputation-based

---

## Guilds

### The Seven Major Guilds
Engineer, Merchant, Healer, Farmer Collective, Artisan Union, Scholar's Circle, Performance Guild

### Guild Functions (all layered)
- **Career gatekeepers** - control training and standards
- **Social clubs** - events, internal politics, rivalries
- **Economic powers** - control prices, materials, market access
- **Political factions** - influence the Shogunate, compete for power

### Membership
- Varies by guild - some are jealous/exclusive, others open to shared membership
- Example: Engineer's Guild might demand exclusivity (trade secrets)
- Example: Artisan Union might welcome cross-pollination

### Day/Night Within Guilds
- Separate chapters - day bakers and night bakers are different social circles
- Guild-wide events are rare day/night crossover moments

---

## Food Culture

### Role in Gameplay
- **Hunger mechanic** - need to eat, food quality affects buffs/mood
- **Social ritual** - sharing meals builds relationships
- **Crafting profession** - deep skill tree with recipes
- **Cultural expression** - reflects provinces, seasons, status

### Sharing Meals (mechanics)
- Relationship boost - eating together increases bond
- Conversation opportunity - meals unlock deeper dialogue
- Buff sharing - quality food benefits both
- Memory creation - certain meals become remembered moments

---

## Spirituality

### What They Practice
- **Ancestor reverence** - honoring those who came before, especially first reincarnates
- **Nature spirituality** - respecting the land, gratitude for what provides
- **Practical mysticism** - the unexplained is accepted, not worshipped

### What They Reject
- **Formal religion** - explicitly rejected as a human concept
- Cats remember that human religion didn't help them when they were cold, hungry, abandoned
- No hierarchy, no doctrine, no organized ceremonies

### Daily Practice
- **Small gestures** - pause before eating, nod to the Gate when passing
- **Personal rituals** - meditation spots, individual practices that vary by cat
- NOT collective observances or organized ceremonies

---

## Mysteries

### Core Mysteries (never explained)
- The Veil between worlds and how it selects cats
- Who built the Great Torii Gate
- Ancient ruins with unknown builders
- Diagnostic mirrors, glow-plants
- Why native cats have no evolutionary history

### How Cats Relate to Mysteries
- **Most cats**: Casual acceptance - "the Gate does what it does"
- **Some scholars**: Study and theorize endlessly, never find definitive answers
- The mysteries remain mysterious

---

## Conflict & Justice

### Conflict Exists (but no war)
- **Boxing rings** - formalized combat sports
- **Illegal zoomies races** - underground night/day racing culture
- **Stealing** - crime exists
- Verbal disputes, competition gone sour, misunderstandings, resource tensions

### Justice System
- **Formal authorities** - guards/magistrates investigate and judge
- **Restitution-focused** - you stole, now pay back double plus community service
- **Never exile** - contradicts the world's core promise of integration
- Always a path back for those who mess up

### Underground Culture (Illegal Zoomies Scene)
- **Thrill-seekers** - cats who find normal life too slow
- **Gambling** - betting on races, underground economy
- **Day/night crossover** - rare neutral ground where both sides mix
- **Misfit community** - informal guild for cats who don't fit the system
- Not "criminal" in a dark way - where edge-seekers find each other

---

## Apprenticeship & Learning

### Varies by Profession
- **Master-apprentice bonds** - one-on-one over years (sushi masters)
- **Guild academies** - formal programs with cohorts (engineers)
- **Learning by doing** - start as helper, gradual responsibility (farmers)
- Each profession has its own training culture and timeline

---

## Becoming Central to Your Town

When a cat succeeds and becomes important locally:
- **Reputation/fame** - NPCs seek you out, first pick of opportunities
- **Economic influence** - your business becomes the hub
- **Social gravity** - others want to befriend you, apprentices want to learn
- **Physical changes** - shop expands, maybe a statue, visible world changes

---

## Key World Rules Confirmed

1. No exile - everyone gets second chances, even those who mess up
2. No religion - spirituality without hierarchy or doctrine
3. No explicit death/abandonment details - hinted, never in-your-face
4. No villains - complex characters with different priorities
5. Basic needs always free - money is for wants, not survival
6. Mysteries stay mysterious - never explained
7. Work is central - but meaningful, not burden
8. Cats are social - relationships unlock everything

---
