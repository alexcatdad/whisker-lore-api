**Native Cats Alone:**
- Native cats lived in Neko-kuni before any isekai'd arrivals
- Simpler technology, smaller population
- Origins of Great Torii Gate unknown (even to natives)
- Mythological period, few records survive
- Clan-based society
- Foundation of current culture laid

**Origins & Evolution Mystery:**
- **No Evolution Theory:** Cats have always existed in this world in their current form
- There is no fossil record of "primitive" cats or evolutionary ancestors
- Native cats are perfect as they are - no need to evolve, no missing links
- **When did the first cat appear?** Unknown. Native cats have no creation myth that provides a definitive answer
- **Were native cats always sentient bipeds?** Unclear. Some scholars believe they transformed ages ago, others believe they've always been this way
