**Food Chain:**
- Cats are TOP of food chain (no predators)
- Cats mostly eat fish, vegetables, rice, processed foods
- Hunting instincts exist but are culturally managed
- Small pest animals controlled by some cats (ratters) but not consumed
- Agriculture protected from wild animals through fencing and deterrents

**Agricultural System:**
- Rice paddies, vegetable gardens, tea plantations, fruit orchards
- Sustainable practices, crop rotation
- Fishing both wild-caught and farmed
- Silk production from domesticated silkworms
- Honey from managed bee colonies

**Natural Balance:**
- Forests maintained for timber, mushrooms, medicinal plants
- Sustainable harvesting practices
- Some areas protected as natural reserves
- Rivers kept clean (important for water wheels and fishing)
