Neko-kuni's justice system reflects the world's core values: integration, help, and acceptance. Everyone deserves a second chance - even those who mess up their second chance.

## Core Principles

### No Exile - Ever
Exile contradicts the world's fundamental promise. Banishing a cat from the community is never an option, no matter the offense. There is always a path back.

### Restorative Over Punitive
Justice focuses on making things right, not making people suffer.

## How Justice Works

### Formal Authorities
- Guards investigate incidents
- Magistrates hear cases and determine appropriate response
- The process is fair but not bureaucratic

### Restitution Focus
- You stole something? Pay back double and perform community service
- Damaged property? Repair it or fund repairs
- Hurt someone's reputation? Make public amends

### Rehabilitation Path
Every consequence includes a path to restoration:
- Community service connects offenders with those they've harmed
- Mentorship programs pair troubled cats with understanding guides
- No permanent records that prevent future opportunities

## What Counts as Crime
- Theft
- Property damage
- Fraud in commerce
- Breaking guild rules (handled internally first)
- Dangerous recklessness

## What Doesn't Exist
- Violence as punishment
- Imprisonment (temporary detention only for immediate danger)
- Permanent exile
- Death penalty
- Shame-based public punishment

## Philosophy
The world is built on the concept that every cat - stray, feral, abandoned - deserves integration and help. A cat who steals is still that cat. Justice helps them find a better path, not removes them from the community.
