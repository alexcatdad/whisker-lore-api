- Modern competitive version with teams and scoring
- Graceful, almost dance-like

**Tsu Chu (Goal Kick):**
- Teams try to kick ball through goal
- Similar to soccer/football but cat-adapted rules
- Physical contact allowed but not rough
- Very popular, every neighborhood has pick-up games
- Professional leagues in major cities
