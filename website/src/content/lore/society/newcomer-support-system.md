The Newcomer Support System was established by the first reincarnates as a "pay it forward" tradition to help cats arriving through the Great Torii Gates.

## Structure
- **Towns**: Dedicated buildings with communal facilities
- **Villages**: A designated NPC helper who assists newcomers

## Services Provided (Free)
- Basic housing (private room in a Naga-ya)
- Basic food and water
- Orientation and guidance

## Staff
All staff are former reincarnates who chose to dedicate themselves to helping others through the transition. They've experienced everything a newcomer faces and serve as living proof that the transformation works.

## Atmosphere
Warm and welcoming - cozy common rooms, gentle staff who've seen this a thousand times. The vibe is supportive, not bureaucratic. Staff give newcomers space but are always available when needed.

## The Arrival Experience
Gates are located on busy roads. Newcomers can ask passersby for directions and get escorted or pointed to the nearest town. There is no formal reception process - it's organic, relying on the kindness of travelers.

### Alternate Path: The Scaredy Cat
Some cats, overwhelmed by their transformation, run away from the gate and avoid the support system entirely. This "scaredy cat" path represents an alternate early experience - solo survival, learning the hard way, eventually finding community on their own terms.
