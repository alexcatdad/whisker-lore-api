The choice between diurnal, nocturnal, and crepuscular life is a core identity decision that shapes a cat's entire experience in Neko-kuni.

## The Three Types

### Diurnal (Day Cats)
Active during daylight hours. Common professions: farmers, merchants, administrators.

### Nocturnal (Night Cats)
Active after dark. Common professions: guards, artists, night market vendors.

### Crepuscular (Twilight Cats)
Active at dawn and dusk, bridging both worlds. Common roles: diplomats, innkeepers, mediators.

## The Social Divide
Day cats and night cats form almost separate communities. They share the same cities but live in different rhythms, see different NPCs, and develop distinct subcultures.

**Tensions arise:**
- Day cats might see night cats as "secretive night-stalkers"
- Night cats might view day cats as "shallow sunbathers"
- These aren't villains - just different perspectives creating friction

## Crepuscular as Bridges
Crepuscular cats occupy a unique social position:
- They know both communities and can move between them
- Key story-important NPCs are often crepuscular
- They're natural mediators in day/night conflicts
- "Jack of all trades, master of none" - less specialized but more versatile
- **Unique ability**: Only crepuscular cats can permanently shift to become fully diurnal or nocturnal

## Guild Implications
Most guilds have separate day and night chapters. The day bakers and night bakers are both in the Baker's Guild, but they're different social circles that rarely interact. Guild-wide events become rare moments where both sides meet.
