- Safe in moderation in this world

**Cultural Taboos:**
- **Mammal Meat:** STRONG TABOO
  - No beef, pork, lamb, etc.
  - Too close to their origins (when they were small animals)
  - Legally banned
  - Breaking this taboo = serious social consequences
- **Bird Meat:** Uncommon, mild taboo
  - Chicken/duck occasionally eaten but uncommon
  - Eggs fine, but killing bird for meat is uncomfortable
  - Some eat it, many don't
  - Regional variation in attitude
