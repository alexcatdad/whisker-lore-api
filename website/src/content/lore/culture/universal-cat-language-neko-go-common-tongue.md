**Origins:** Ancient, predates recorded history. Likely evolved naturally among native cats, adopted by isekai'd cats upon arrival.

**Characteristics:**

*Spoken Form:*
- Melodic, uses full range of feline vocalizations plus articulated speech
- Meows, chirps, trills integrated into speech patterns
- Purring can indicate tone/emotion while speaking
- Hissing used for emphasis or strong emotion (not always negative)
- Phonetically rich - many consonants and vowels
- Tonal elements (pitch matters for some words)

*Written Form:*
- Pictographic characters combined with phonetic elements
- Characters based on paw prints, claw marks, and natural forms
- About 2,000 common characters (literacy requires ~1,500)
- Cursive form (faster writing) and formal form (artistic)
- Written vertically (top to bottom, right to left) traditionally
- Some modern texts written horizontally

*Structure:*
- Subject-Object-Verb word order typically
- Context-heavy (pronouns often dropped if clear)
- Honorifics built into verbs and pronouns (indicate social relationship)
- Classifier system for counting (different counters for different object types)

**Function:**
- Lingua franca across all provinces
- Official government language
- Trade language
- Education conducted in Neko-go
- All cats can speak it (isekai'd cats gain fluency quickly - mysterious but accepted)
