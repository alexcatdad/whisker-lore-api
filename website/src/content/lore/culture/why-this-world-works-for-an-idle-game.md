**The Core Loop Makes Emotional Sense:**
- You're not just grinding resources
- You're helping your cat find peace, purpose, and identity
- Every skill learned is personal growth
- Every friendship made is connection
- Every home improvement is stability
- Progress = becoming who you're meant to be

**Idle Mechanics Match Theme:**
- Cats napping generates power (solar collectors)
- Time passing = resources accumulating
- Your absence = cat lives their life
- Returns = "coming home" emotionally

**Multiple Time Scales:**
- Minute-to-minute: Small tasks, interactions
- Session-to-session: Quest progress, relationships
- Long-term: Career progression, property ownership, legacy

**Always Something To Do:**
- But never overwhelming
- Can focus on one aspect or dabble in all
- Your pace, your priorities
- Respect for player agency
