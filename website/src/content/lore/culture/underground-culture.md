Neko-kuni is a peaceful world, but it's not naive. An underground culture exists for cats who need more edge than daily life provides.

## Illegal Zoomies Races
High-speed foot races through city streets, rooftops, and countryside. Unsanctioned, thrilling, and technically illegal.

**The Scene:**
- **Thrill-seekers**: Cats who find normal life too slow, who need adrenaline
- **Gambling**: Betting on race outcomes creates an underground economy
- **Day/Night Crossover**: One of the few places where diurnal and nocturnal cats mix freely - neutral ground where circadian identity doesn't matter
- **Misfit Community**: An informal "guild" for cats who don't fit the official guild system

## Boxing Rings
Formalized combat sports with rules and honor. Violence is channeled, not random. Matches are about skill, not cruelty.

## Theft
Crime exists. Some cats steal. This isn't glamorized, but it's acknowledged as part of reality.

## What This Culture Represents
The underground isn't "criminal" in a dark sense. It's where edge-seekers find each other, where the rules are different, where cats who don't fit discover they're not alone.

## The Tone
Even the underground maintains the world's core values. Rivalry is healthy competition. Risks are taken with consent. The community looks after its own. This is cozy-adjacent, not grimdark.
