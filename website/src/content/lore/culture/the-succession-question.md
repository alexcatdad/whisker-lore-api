**Shogun Tora is Aging:**
- Now 75 years old (in human equivalent)
- Health declining
- Still sharp mentally but physically weaker
- No clear heir designated

**Potential Successors:**
- **General Kurogane:** Military choice. Strong, traditional, respected by Samurai class. Conservative policies.
- **Lady Koban (Daimyo of Minato-kassei):** Political/economic choice. Merchant backing, progressive, pragmatic. Would shift power toward commerce.
- **Lord Tetsu (Daimyo of Yama-takumi):** Progressive/technological choice. Engineer Guild support, innovative, younger generation. Would accelerate modernization.

**Political Maneuvering:**
- Daimyos positioning for advantage
- Factions forming and reforming
- Intrigue and alliances shifting
- Could lead to instability or even conflict
- Shogun aware but hasn't decided

**Public Concern:**
- Widespread anxiety about transition
- Memories of Territorial Wars make stability precious
- Debates in tea houses and taverns
- Some calling for new system (parliament?), others want strong Shogun
