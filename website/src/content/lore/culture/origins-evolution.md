**The No Evolution Paradox:**
- Cats have always existed in current form
- No fossil record of primitive ancestors
- No evidence of evolution
- Just... are, and always have been
- Native cats accept this, isekai'd cats find it strange

**When Did The First Cat Appear?**
- Unknown
- No creation myth provides clear answer
- Native cats: "We have always been here"
- Time before written records is foggy
- Ancient texts don't clarify

**Were Native Cats Always Sentient?**
- Or did they transform too, ages ago?
- No records of "before sentience"
- Cultural memory doesn't extend that far
- Philosophical debate, no conclusion
