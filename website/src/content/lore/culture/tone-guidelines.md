**Cozy But Not Saccharine:**
- Warm and inviting
- But acknowledges difficulty
- Real struggles, real growth
- Comfort without being cloying

**Meaningful Without Being Heavy:**
- Depth without depression
- Serious themes treated respectfully
- But not oppressive
- Lightness and humor exist

**Hopeful But Acknowledging Difficulty:**
- Things get better
- But not instantly or easily
- Realistic optimism
- Earned happiness

**Whimsical Yet Grounded:**
- Magical realism elements
- Whisker-Punk wonder
- But feels real and lived-in
- Not random or arbitrary

**Beautiful But Lived-In:**
- Aesthetic worlds
- But functional, used
- Weathered not pristine
- Authentic not sterile
