**Who Built the Great Torii Gate?**
- Predates recorded history
- Even native cats don't know
- Some say gods, some say ancient civilization
- No evidence either way
- Still functions perfectly
- Why does it attract isekai'd cats?

**What is the True Nature of The Veil?**
- How does it work?
- Why do only cats cross it (as far as known)?
- Can it be controlled or predicted?
- Are there other Veils to other places?
- Is it natural or created?

**Are There Other Realms?**
- Besides Neko-kuni and the human world
- Do other species have their own worlds?
- Philosophical speculation only
- No evidence

**What Causes the Transformation?**
- From small animal to sentient being
- Is it The Veil? The world itself?
- Gradual or instant? (Cats don't remember the moment)
- Why does it happen?
- Can it be reversed? (No one has tried or wants to)

**Why Do Cats Get This Second Chance?**
- What makes cats special?
- Is it random? Earned? Gift?
- Purpose behind it?
- Or no reason at all?
