**Mostly Good Relations:**
- Majority live peacefully together
- Intermarriage/partnerships common
- Shared goals and communities

**But Some Resentment:**
- **Some Natives:** Resent isekai'd dominance in certain fields (engineering, commerce)
  - "They come here and change everything"
  - Feel culture being lost
  - Nationalism/nativism (small but vocal minority)
  
- **Some Isekai'd Cats:** Feel they're "fixing" a backward society
  - "We brought progress"
  - Condescending attitudes
  - Don't respect traditions they don't understand

**Generational Differences:**
- Isekai'd kittens born here (second generation)
- Are they native or isekai'd?
- Identity questions
- Usually integrate seamlessly
- Some face questions about "authenticity"

**Identity Questions:**
- What does it mean to be "from Neko-kuni"?
- Is it birthplace or culture?
- Can isekai'd cats ever truly belong?
- Most say yes, but debates exist

**Core Existential Struggle (Universal):**
- The adjustment from being small, dependent animals to fully sentient beings
- This affects all isekai'd cats regardless of when they arrived
- Learning to handle:
  - **Overwhelm:** "I just wanted food and warmth, now I need a career?"
  - **Purpose Anxiety:** "What am I supposed to do with this life?"
  - **Imposter Syndrome:** "Everyone else seems to know how to be a person"
  - **Decision Paralysis:** Too many choices after a life of few options
  - **Nostalgia:** Missing the simplicity of animal existence
  - **Guilt:** Feeling they don't deserve this second chance
- This is the central emotional journey of the game
