**Player Agency:**
- Meaningful choices
- Multiple paths to success
- Your story, your way
- Consequences matter but aren't punishing

**No Punishment for Taking Breaks:**
- Idle game elements
- Progress continues
- Welcome back, not "you failed"
- Respect player's time

**Multiple Valid Paths:**
- No "best" career or lifestyle
- Different choices, different experiences
- Replayability through variety
- All paths have value

**Horizontal and Vertical Progression:**
- Get better at things (vertical)
- But also try new things (horizontal)
- Depth and breadth both rewarded
- No dead ends

**Social Systems Enhance But Don't Require:**
- Can play solo successfully
- But relationships add richness
- Optional not mandatory
- Rewards for both playstyles

**Accessibility:**
- Casual players welcome
- But depth for dedicated players
- Easy to learn, hard to master
- Accommodating different playstyles
