**Economic Power Rivaling Political Power:**
- Merchant Guild incredibly wealthy
- Fund infrastructure projects
- Influence through economic leverage
- Can make or break provincial economies

**Seeking Formal Representation:**
- Want seats in government councils
- Currently political power held by Shogun/Daimyo (military aristocracy)
- Merchants feel underrepresented
- "No taxation without representation" sentiment

**Traditional Nobles Resistant:**
- Samurai class sees merchants as lower status
- Fear losing political dominance
- "Money shouldn't buy power" (ironic, but traditional view)
- Some nobles in debt to merchants (awkward)

**Could Reshape Political Structure:**
- Possible constitutional reforms
- Merchant representation in exchange for economic support
- Hybrid system emerging?
- Or backlash and crackdown?

**Wealth Inequality Concerns:**
- Growing gap between rich and poor
- Most have necessities (safety net) but some very wealthy
- Luxury in Minato-kassei vs. rural poverty
- Social mobility exists but unequal
- Populist movements emerging
