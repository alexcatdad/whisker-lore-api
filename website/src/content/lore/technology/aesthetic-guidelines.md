**Materials:** Brass, copper, bronze, wood (especially bamboo and cherry), paper, glass, stone

**Colors:** Warm metals, natural wood tones, soft warm lighting, occasional bright accents

**Shapes:** Organic curves, circular elements, spirals, natural forms integrated with geometric precision

**Sound:** Gentle mechanical purring, steam hissing, bells chiming, gears clicking, water flowing

**Lighting:** Warm and soft - gas lamps, glow-lanterns, candles, never harsh or cold

**Design Philosophy:** Nothing is purely functional - everything has artistic merit, ornamentation tells stories, gears and mechanisms are celebrated not hidden
