Cats retain a vague awareness that humans and the human world exist, but specific memories fade quickly after arrival. They know intellectually that humans are real, that they came from "somewhere else," but the details blur like a half-remembered dream. This creates an interesting disconnect - they know they were once small, dependent creatures, but now they walk upright, speak, build civilizations. The transformation itself is part of the mystery.
