**World Shape:** Neko-kuni exists on a round planet with oceans, continents, and diverse climates. The Whisker Shogunate occupies one major continent, but cats are aware of other lands across the seas.

**Exploration Status:** Most of the world has been mapped and explored by cat civilizations. Major geographic features, trade routes, and neighboring kingdoms are well documented. There are still remote regions and deep ocean areas that remain mysterious, but the age of major discovery has largely passed.

**Other Cat Civilizations:** 
The Whisker Shogunate is just one of several cat nations across the world:
- **The Whisker Shogunate** - Feudal, honor-based, technological innovators (our focus)
- **The Desert Sultanate** - Merchant princes, oasis cities, ancient libraries  
- **The Northern Clans** - Tribal confederation, harsh climate survivors
- **The Island Republics** - Democratic city-states, naval power, traders
- **The Steppe Khanate** - Nomadic empire, fierce warriors, horse-cat culture
- (More to be detailed for future expansions)

Each civilization has its own culture, government, and relationship with the Shogunate - some are allies, others rivals, some neutral trading partners.
