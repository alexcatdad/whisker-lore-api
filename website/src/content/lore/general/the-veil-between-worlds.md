When a cat dies, is abandoned, or becomes truly lost in our world, they sometimes find **The Veil** - a threshold between dimensions that appears differently to each cat:
- A warm sunbeam streaming through a window
- An open garden gate
- A cardboard box that feels safe
- A quiet alley that seems to lead somewhere else
