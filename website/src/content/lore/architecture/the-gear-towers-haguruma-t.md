**Function:** Central power generation and distribution for districts

**Layout:**
- Base: Water intake or whisker-static generation chambers
- Lower floors: Primary gears and drive mechanisms
- Middle floors: Open mechanical galleries (gears, pistons, flywheels)
- Upper floors: Distribution control, maintenance access
- Top: Boiler systems, cooling towers, or static collectors

**Materials:**
- Lower: Stone and heavy timber foundation
- Middle: Timber frame with metal reinforcement, large openings to show mechanisms
- Upper: More metal structure visible, metal roof panels

**Spectacular Mechanical Display:**
- Gears from 1 foot to 15 feet in diameter
- Brass, bronze, and copper with steel teeth
- Visible through large arched openings
- Multiple levels of gears at different scales
- Central vertical drive shaft visible through building
- Pistons, connecting rods, flywheels in motion
- Steam pipes with brass fittings, pressure gauges
- Catwalks and ladders for maintenance
- Gentle mechanical sounds - rhythmic, not harsh
- Chimneys releasing steam
- Distribution pipes running underground and overhead to nearby buildings
- Safety features: pressure release valves, emergency shutoffs
- Bells or whistles for shift changes, emergencies

**Colors:** Warm metals (brass, bronze, copper), weathered to show patina (green, brown), dark wood, functional grey
