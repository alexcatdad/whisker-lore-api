**How Architecture Reflects Social Structure:**

*Class Visibility:*
- Building size and quality immediately indicate status
- Noble estates: Large, elaborate, gated, hilltop
- Samurai homes: Modest but quality construction, defensive walls
- Merchant: Variable wealth on display, some very grand
- Artisan: Functional, attached workshops, pride in craft
- Newcomer: Shared housing, but dignified not squalid

*Community Creation:*
- Machiya rows create defined neighborhoods
- Shared courtyards in housing blocks create natural gathering spots
- Commercial streets mix residential upper floors ensuring 24-hour community presence
- Public spaces (baths, markets, theaters) designed for social interaction
- Guild halls serve as community centers for professions

*Accessibility:*
- Streets designed for various transport: foot, cart, cable car
- Bridges at multiple points ensuring connectivity
- Public spaces (temples, gardens, markets) open to all classes
- Bath houses mixed-class (though some premium options exist)
- Clear signage (vertical text boards, symbols for illiterate)

*Economic Display:*
- Successful merchants invest in elaborate shop fronts
- Guilds compete in hall impressiveness
- Personal wealth shown in home improvements, gardens
- Public works (bridges, towers, walls) funded by wealthy as status/legacy
- Balance: Ostentation discouraged by tradition, but quality respected

*Cultural Values in Design:*
- Respect for nature: Gardens integrated, natural materials, buildings frame views
- Craftsmanship: Joinery visible and appreciated, quality over shortcuts
- Community: Shared spaces prioritized, homes open to street interaction
- Balance: Traditional and modern elements coexist
- Harmony: Buildings fit context rather than compete
