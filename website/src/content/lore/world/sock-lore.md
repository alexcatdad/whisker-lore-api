Socks from our world have a mysterious tendency to appear in Neko-kuni.

## The Phenomenon
Lost socks - the ones that disappear from dryers, fall behind furniture, or simply vanish - sometimes end up in Neko-kuni. No one knows why. It's accepted as one of the world's many unexplained phenomena.

## Emotional Significance
For isekai'd cats, finding their human's sock can be profoundly meaningful. The sock still carries the scent of home, of the person they loved. Some cats travel across all five provinces searching for this small piece of their past.

## As a Personal Quest
"Find my human's sock" is a valid personal quest option during character creation. It's whimsical on the surface but touches something deep - the connection between a cat and their person, the desire to hold onto what was lost.

## Resolution
Like all personal quests, finding the sock is player-driven:
- Some cats search relentlessly and eventually find it
- Some realize the sock is less important than the life they've built
- Some find peace in the journey itself

The sock exists somewhere. Whether finding it matters is up to the cat.
