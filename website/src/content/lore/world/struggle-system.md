The Struggle System reflects how a cat's past life shapes their starting challenges and strengths in Neko-kuni.

## Core Principle
Backstory creates mechanical "Struggle" buffs and debuffs that affect early gameplay. A cat's history isn't just flavor - it determines their starting advantages and difficulties.

## Main Categories

### Housecat
Lived with humans in a domestic setting.

**Subtypes:**
- **Pampered Indoor Cat**: Never went outside, everything provided. May struggle with independence but excels at comfort-seeking and rest efficiency.
- **Shop Cat**: Lived in a bookstore/bodega, used to strangers and commerce. Social buffs, commerce aptitude.
- **Farm Cat**: Semi-independent, had "jobs" (mousing), outdoor access. Work ethic, practical skills, but may resist structure.
- **Elderly Companion**: Bonded deeply with one person, possibly outlived them. Deep emotional capacity, potential grief debuff.
- **Shelter Cat**: Knew multiple homes, learned to adapt. Resilience and flexibility, but possible trust issues.

### Stray
Survived on streets or in the wild with some human contact.
- Survival skills, street smarts
- Trust issues, difficulty accepting help
- Self-reliance buffs

### Feral
Born wild, minimal human contact.
- Strongest survival instincts
- Most difficulty with social integration
- May have advantages in certain physical skills

## Additional Dimensions

### Geographic Origin
A cat from Tokyo versus Cairo versus New York arrives with different cultural tendencies and knowledge.

### Unusual Circumstances
- Ship's cat (sea legs, travel experience)
- Circus cat (performance skills, crowd comfort)
- Celebrity's cat (used to attention, possibly spoiled)
- Laboratory cat (may have unusual knowledge or trauma)

## What's NOT Explicit
Manner of death or abandonment is hinted at but never made explicit. The tone stays hopeful - cats are here now, and that's what matters.
