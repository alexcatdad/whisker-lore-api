Every player's cat has a Personal Quest baked into their character sheet - an emotional drive that pulls them forward beyond just "get a job, make friends."

## Examples of Personal Quests
- Find a cat from their past life
- Find a cat they should have met but didn't
- Find something an ancestor left in this world
- Find the perfect nap spot in the world
- Find their favorite toy (transported separately from them)
- Find their human's sock (connects to the sock lore - socks from our world appear in Neko-kuni)

## Resolution Options (Player Choice)

Personal quests respect player agency. Resolution can happen in multiple ways:

1. **Pursue Actively**: Chase the quest across all five provinces, make it central to your journey
2. **Let It Fade**: Build a new life, let the quest recede into the background organically
3. **Explicit Letting Go**: A deliberate moment where you choose to release the past

### The "Letting Go" Branch
When a cat explicitly chooses to let go of their personal quest, it's not failure - it's transformation. This triggers a new story/world branch for that player. The cat who releases their past gets a different story than the one who finds their sock. Both are complete journeys.

## Design Philosophy
The personal quest provides emotional throughline for the idle game mechanics. Progress isn't just resource accumulation - it's helping your cat find peace, purpose, and identity.
